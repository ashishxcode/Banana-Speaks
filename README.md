### Tech

Banana Speaks uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Funtranslations](https://funtranslations.com/minion) - Translation of data
- [VanialJS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [VS-Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) - Awesome text editor
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - Hosting Website

And of course Banana Speaks itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/ashishxcode/Banana-Speaks) on GitHub.
